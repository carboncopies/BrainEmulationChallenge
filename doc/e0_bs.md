# Ball-and-stick neurons - Example VBP specification

The ball-and-stick example is intended to provide the simplest in-silico case with the smallest
number of variables to address while still demonstrating the full process and dependencies
chain for whole brain emulation.

It is an E0 level example, because there are only 2 "neurons" involved.

## Overview

1. Specify a known ground-truth (KGT) model.
2. Specify double-blind data acquisition from the KGT.
3. Specify a system identification process using the data.
4. Specify a validation procedure for the resulting emulation.
