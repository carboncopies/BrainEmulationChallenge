# Notes on taking the challenge

## First interaction with the challenge taker

1. Send acquired data sets for the BS and SC XOR ground-truth systems. Actually, just make this public. The website will have the data and a description of how to take the challenge.


## Example of challenge participant taking the challenge

The participant works with high resolution microscopy data, primarily EM, and has a method
of reconstruction that involves identifying neurons and neural processes in EM data,
recreating a supposed connectome from that. The participant's method then involves
simply counting the pixels of a visible postsynaptic densitiy (PSD) and the number of such
PSDs between two neurons to establish a candidate strength of the connection. The
participant's method then compares all candidate connection strengths to determine
relative strengths and from that establishe a range of supposed cumulative conductances
between each pair of neurons. The participant's method assumes that the visible volume of
a neuron found in the EM data set can be used to identify it as either a principal neuron
or an interneuron. The participant wishes to use this method to participate in the
challenge. The participant therefore seeks challenge EM data sets to work with.
