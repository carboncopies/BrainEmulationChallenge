The Brain Emulation Challenge aims to accelerate neural circuit reconstruction and brain emulation by creating standardized reference brains with fully understood circuit structure and functional representations. With the advent of high-throughput electron microscopy (EM), expansion microscopy (ExM), Calcium and voltage imaging, and co-registered combinations of these techniques, we can now acquire high-resolution data sets that span multiple brain regions or entire small animal brains.

## The Problem

Current neuroscience research relies on correlational studies, which are indirect methods for studying a complex system. Large-scale, high-resolution reconstruction of brain circuitry is needed to achieve mechanistic explanations and predictions of cognitive function. However, there is a lack of published and validated attempts to reconstruct neuronal circuit function that successfully reproduces the full range of information processing.

## The Solution

We propose creating a multi-tiered training data set generated from carefully crafted in-silico models of virtual "ground-truth" brain tissue. This approach has been successful in artificial intelligence, where standardized data sets and challenges have driven algorithmic improvements.

## Challenge Series

Our challenge series consists of successively more sophisticated data sets, each with associated abstractions and simplifications. By gradually increasing the complexity of the data sets, we can aid testing and improvement of analysis and translation methods.
